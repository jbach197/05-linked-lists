# Installation Instructions
1) Clone the repo
2) Run npm i to install the dependencies
3) Run npm test to complete the tests
4) Run npm lint for the linter

#Requirements
* Implement a singly linked list data structure.
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* Note the it's Big-O runtime
Inert and delete have a Big-O of O(1), reverse has O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the list.

#Testing
Use the `describe` and `it` (or `test`) methods to define descriptive tests and increase readablity
Each `it` callback should aim to test a small, well defined, feature of a function - this may include:
  * tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
  * tests that the correct errors are thrown with invalid arguments exist
  * tests to ensure that the list module functions return the correct results when invoked with valid arguments


#Worked with and Credits
